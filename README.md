## Introduction

This project is a desktop application designed to predict whether a person has Alzheimer's disease. The GUI is created using the `customTkinter` library in Python. The backend prediction model is based on our published [research paper](https://www.ijser.org/onlineResearchPaperViewer.aspx?Alzheimer_s_Disease_Occurrence_A_Multivariate_Logistic_Regression_Approach_Using_OASIS_Brain_Data.pdf), which leverages advanced machine learning techniques to make accurate predictions.

## Features

- User-friendly GUI developed with `customTkinter`.
- Input patient data to predict the likelihood of Alzheimer's disease.
- Real-time prediction results.
- Visualization of input data and prediction results.
- Easy to install and use.

## Installation

### Prerequisites

- Python 3.6 or higher
- `customTkinter` library
- Other dependencies as listed in `requirements.txt`

### Steps

1. Clone the repository:
   ```sh
   git clone https://github.com/anish0094/Alzheimer-disease.git
2. Navigate to the project directory:
   ```sh
   cd Alzheimer-disease
3. Install the required packages:
   ```sh
   pip install -r requirements.txt:
4. Run the application:
   ```sh
   python main.py


## Usage
1. Launch the application by running python main.py.
2. Enter the necessary patient data in the provided fields.
3. Click on the "Submit" button to get the prediction results.
4. View the results displayed in the application interface.

## Model Details
The prediction model used in this application is detailed in our research paper titled "Predicting Alzheimer's Disease Using Advanced Machine Learning Techniques". The model was trained using a comprehensive dataset and validated to ensure high accuracy and reliability.
