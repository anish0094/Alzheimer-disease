## Introduction

This project is a desktop application designed to predict whether a person has Alzheimer's disease. The GUI is created using the `customTkinter` library in Python. The backend prediction model is based on our published [research paper](https://www.ijser.org/onlineResearchPaperViewer.aspx?Alzheimer_s_Disease_Occurrence_A_Multivariate_Logistic_Regression_Approach_Using_OASIS_Brain_Data.pdf), which leverages advanced machine learning techniques to make accurate predictions.

## Features

- User-friendly GUI developed with `customTkinter`.
- Input patient data to predict the likelihood of Alzheimer's disease.
- Real-time prediction results.
- Visualization of input data and prediction results.
- Easy to install and use.

## Installation
